# Status Code

400 - bad request
201 - created 



# Generate Token

- create arrow function
- have id parameter because we're going to use the id of use to generate token
- create JWT_SECRET in .env file.
for example
------------
const generateToken =(id) =>{
    return jwt.sign(
        {id},
        process.env.JWT_SECRET,
        {expiresIn:'1d' }
    )
};


# Register User

- When we want to register a user , what's the first thing we do?
- we need some credentials from that user credentials being the name , the email and the password. destructed it out from req.body
- validation
  - what if those information are not send from the request/frontend
  - if(!name || !email || !password ) return error and message;
- check if user exists - find in the database
- if the user does not exist ? then register the user.
  - create new user
- when create the new log that user in immediately
- how to log that use
- we are going to generate a token , a JSON web token and then send that token along with cookies
- res.cookie(name,sendgeneratetoken(token),object)
- if user is actually create then send response to frontend if not created and throw error 
- user agent - either user browser or the user device.
- we going to capture that when the user signs up.
- because we're able to capture that, if the user try to log in from another device , we can tigger as two factor authentication. 
- npm i ua-parser-js
